# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
## Installation instructions

`git clone git@github.com:JoshuaGross/CourseraGettingCleaningDataCourseProj.git`

## Usage

`Rscript run_analysis.R`

## Review Criteria
* The submitted data set is tidy.
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
* The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

## `run_analysis.R` criteria

You should create one R script called `run_analysis.R` that does the following.

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
